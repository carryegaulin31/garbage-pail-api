# garbage-pail-api

This A.P.I is for all you 80's kids that remember chewing every last piece of gum from each and every package of cards with eyes wide in astonishment. Before they were banned from your elementary school of course! Enjoy the trip down memory lane.

The Routes are on the index page but also there will be
GETS for A and B set Cards, to get all cards and to get cards by name.  There will also be a route to add a card if there have been any missed or if new series are to be added.

GET/ Single Card in "A" List (/alist/)
GET/ Cards by "B" List (/b)
GET/ Single Card by "B" List (/blist/)
